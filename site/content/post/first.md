Swymm is an interactive, crowdsourced timeline of all history. Swymm’s mission is to provide an open platform for cataloging and visualizing time-based data of all kinds, and thereby enable anyone to discover, learn from, and contribute to humanity’s understanding of history.

## Philosophy

Timelines are generally designed to tell a particular story, from a particular viewpoint, to a particular reader. Swymm is designed to allow anyone to discover their own stories by making all the data available at once and putting search and filtering into the hands of the user.

## How it Works

Swymm is comprised of:

* A definitive world database of time data: principally event records throughout the past and to the present, but also, in the future, any other time-series data that can be usefully compared and contrasted to any other data in the Swymm’s database.
* An interactive visualization with unique design and features that enable search, filtering, editing and comparison: instantly seeing what else was going on at the same time as your search query.
* A user contribution engine that makes it easy to submit data while managing quality via a novel combination of peer review, user karma, and an innovative “quality index” for every event record in the database.

Swymm is founded and developed by [Ted Hayes](t3db0t.com).
